### ðŸ“‚ Included Lessons

1. **Simple Linear Regression**  
   Learn how to fit a line through data points using a single feature.

2. **Multiple Linear Regression**  
   Explore how models can handle multiple input features to make predictions.

3. **Logistic Regression**  
   Understand classification using sigmoid functions, with interactive probability curves.
